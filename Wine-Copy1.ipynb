Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco.                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "150909  This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "150910  Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.                                                                                                              \n",
       "150911  This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins. A bit chalky in the finish, it's a relatively light style that is pleasant and pretty once it has opened up.                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "150912  The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit \"lifted\" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price.                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "150913  Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like ’em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but there’s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least.   \n",
       "150914  Old-gold in color, and thick and syrupy. The aromas run to caramel, apricots, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan pie and crème brûlée. Tastes as voluptuous as it smells. Fantastic concentration and depth; a nectar bursting with sweet, gorgeous fruit. The acidity is high, but it feels soft and creamy. Residual sugar of 28% makes it tooth-achingly sweet. Only 554 cases produced, but worth the search.                               \n",
       "150915  Decades ago, Beringer’s then-winemaker Myron Nightingale created an artificial method of introducing the botrytis to Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, with great results. This splendid version has strong aromas of crème brûlée, vanilla custard, honey, apricot purée and a warm note of peach pie fresh out of the oven. The taste is, in a word, fabulous. This is a nectar fit for the gods.                                            \n",
       "150916  An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "150917  Light and elegant, this spicy, lively wine is a gentle joy. There is a precision and refinement evident here that makes other Champagnes seem almost clumsy. The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice.                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "150918  Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles. Flavors of slightly overripe apples lead into a mature palate with hints of oxidation. Sherry, nuts, olive oil, vanilla and other less identifiable nuances meld into a rich, ripe, satisfying and complex whole.                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "150919  This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "150920  Rich and mature aromas of smoke, earth and herbs announce this surprise. The palate offers complex fruit, herb and mineral notes, and while mature, it has great mouthfeel and acidity. The dry finish has length and shows a reprise of the smoke and mineral elements from before. Best Buy.                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "150921  Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.                                                                                                                  \n",
       "150922  Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.                                                                                       \n",
       "150923  Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.        \n",
       "150924  Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.                                                                     \n",
       "150925  Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italy’s most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones. The structure and mouthfeel are what many Italian whites strive for but never reach. An elegant wine.                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "150926  Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "150927  This classic example comes from a cru vineyard called Terre di Dora, which is named after the Mastroberardinos’ mother. They should all be proud of this one. Wet stones, apples, peaches and pears start it off. On the palate, the structure and mouthfeel are nearly perfect. The finish features the butterscotch tones of malolactic fermentation. A wonderful example of what Fiano di Avellino can be.                                     \n",
       "150928  A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus.
